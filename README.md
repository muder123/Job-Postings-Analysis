# Job-Postings-Analysis

This project aims at predicting salary and job title categories using classification models.

The procedures mainly involve web scraping, data cleaning, feature selection, NLP and modelling.

Python is the programming language to achieve this. (the code may not be perfectly organised for others' use, content in parenthesis will be removed when reorganised)
